OVERVIEW:

New York City, with a population of over 8 million, experiences thousands of motor vehicle collisions each year. These incidents are influenced by various factors, ranging from driver behavior to vehicle type. By analyzing data from motor vehicle collisions, we aim to uncover trends and insights that can help reduce injuries and fatalities while improving traffic safety. This analysis focuses on motor vehicle collision data collected by the NYPD. The dataset spans multiple years and provides detailed records of crashes, including contributing factors, borough-level statistics, and vehicle types involved. 

The dataset includes the following key columns:
BOROUGH: The borough where the collision occurred.
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR VEHICLE 1: The primary cause of the collision.
NUMBER OF PERSONS KILLED: Number of fatalities in the collision.
NUMBER OF PERSONS INJURED: Number of injuries in the collision.
VEHICLE TYPE CODE 1: Type of vehicle involved in the collision.
